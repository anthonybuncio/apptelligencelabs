                Permission is granted to temporarily access and use the Site for
                personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the

                <li>
                  Remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the

              </ul>
              <p>
                This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of
                these restrictions and may be terminated by us at any time. Upon
                terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the
                termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded

              <h2 className="font-semibold">3. Disclaimer</h2>
              <p>
                The materials on the Site are provided on an &quot;as is&quot;
                basis. We make no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby
                disclaim and negate all other warranties, including without
                limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability,
                fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of
                intellectual property or other violation of rights. Further, we
                do not warrant or make any representations concerning the
                accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the
                materials on the Site or otherwise relating to such materials or
                on any sites linked to the Site.
              </p>
              <br />

              <h2 className="font-semibold">4. Limitations</h2>
              <p>
                In no event shall Apptelligence Labs or its suppliers be liable
                for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss
                of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out
                of the use or inability to use the materials on the Site, even
                if Apptelligence Labs or a Apptelligence Labs authorized
                representative has been notified orally or in writing of the
                possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not
                allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of
                liability for consequential or incidental damages, these
                limitations may not apply to you.
              </p>
              <br />

              <h2 className="font-semibold">5. Modifications</h2>
              <p>
                We may revise these Terms of Service at any time without prior
                notice. By using the Site, you are agreeing to be bound by the
                then-current version of these Terms.
              </p>
              <br />

              <h2 className="font-semibold">6. Governing Law</h2>
              <p>
                These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with
                the laws of [Your Jurisdiction], without regard to its conflict
                of law provisions.
